		<!-- Bio Paragraph -->
		<p>Hello! My name is Katie (well, actually it's Katarina) and I live in Durham, North Carolina. I grew up on a farm in northern Maryland (only half a mile from Pennsylvania!), spent nine years living in Portland, Oregon, and returned to the east coast in early 2014 to see what the South had to offer.</p>
		<p>I have driven across the country five times, have two Oregon-born cats, and like to spend my free time fixing up my house (photos can be found under the #cutehouseiscute tag on Instagram) and eating spicy foods. Some of my favorite things to do in Durham are to go hiking on the Eno and explore new breweries in the area!</p>
